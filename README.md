# cash-flow-minimizer
This C program solves the cash settlement problem by minimizing the number of transactions among multiple parties. It first calculates each party’s net balance from given debtor–creditor transactions. Debtors have negative balances, while creditors have positive ones. Using a greedy approach, the program repeatedly matches the largest debtor with the largest creditor, settling the minimum possible amount in each step. This reduces at least one balance to zero per iteration. The process continues until all debts are cleared. The program then displays the settlements and the total number of transactions required, ensuring efficient and fair debt resolution.
